Put the file somwhere.
Run chmod +x filename.sh on it.
Run it using a terminal.
It'll start from the beginning and work it's way though. 
It'll make 2 files one with:
taken_domains.txt (so you can see it works)
free_domains.txt (that's the one with the gold).

Change the settings so it works for what you are looking for.
