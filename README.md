Put the file somwhere.<br>
Run chmod +x filename.sh on it.<br>
Run it using a terminal.<br>
It'll start from the beginning and work its way through. <br>
It'll make 2 files one with:<br>
taken_domains.txt (so you can see it works)<br>
free_domains.txt (that's the one with the gold).<br>

Change the settings so it works for what you are looking for.
